Dataset: A dataset of 20,632 Kickstarter campaigns was analyzed to determine the factors that contribute to a campaign's success. The most successful campaigns were typically in the technology and design categories, had a clear and concise blurb, a well-produced video, launched on a weekend, reached their funding goal within the first few days, and had a large number of backers. These findings can be used by campaign creators to improve their chances of success on Kickstarter.
